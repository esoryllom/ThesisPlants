40 Shrub: a low usually several-stemmed woody plant
30 Liana: : any of various usually woody vines especially of tropical rain forests that root in the ground
40 Vine: a plant whose stem requires support and which climbs by tendrils or twining or creeps along the ground

20 Epiphytic: living on the surface of plants
50 Aquatic:: growing or living in or frequenting water
40 Terrestrial : living on or in or growing from land
30 Opposite: situated in pairs on an axis (see AXIS sense 3) with each member being separated from the other by half the circumference (see CIRCUMFERENCE sense 2) of the axis
30 Alternate: : arranged first on one side and then on the other at different levels or points along an axial line
40 Whorl : an arrangement of similar anatomical parts (such as leaves) in a circle around a point on an axis
50 Entire : having the margin continuous or free from indentations
30 Dentate : : having teeth or pointed conical projections
Double Dentate
40 Lobed: a curved or rounded projection or division
40 Serrate : notched or toothed on the edge specifically : having marginal teeth pointing forward or toward the apex
40 Spines : a stiff pointed plant process especially : one that is a modified leaf or leaf part
40 Rhizome : a somewhat elongated usually horizontal subterranean plant stem that is often thickened by deposits of reserve food material, produces shoots above and roots below, and is distinguished from a true root in possessing buds, nodes, and usually scalelike leaves
20 Culm : a monocotyledonous stem (as of a grass or sedge)
30 Stolon: a horizontal branch from the base of a plant that produces new plants from buds at its tip or nodes (as in the strawberry)
40 Bulb : a resting stage of a plant (such as the lily, onion, hyacinth, or tulip) that is usually formed underground and consists of a short stem base bearing one or more buds enclosed in overlapping membranous or fleshy leaves
40 Tubers: a short fleshy usually underground stem bearing minute scale leaves each of which bears a bud in its axil and is potentially able to produce a new plant
30 Corms: a rounded thick modified underground stem base bearing membranous or scaly leaves and buds and acting as a vegetative reproductive structure
30 Actinomorphic: being radially symmetrical and capable of division by any longitudinal plane into essentially symmetrical halves
30 Zygomorphic: having floral parts unequal in size or form so that the flower is capable of division into essentially symmetrical halves by only one longitudinal plane passing through the axis
30 Umbel: a racemose inflorescence typical of the carrot family in which the pedicels arise from about the same point to form a flat or rounded flower cluster
40 Florets: a small flower especially : one of the small flowers forming the head of a composite plant
50 Paired: something made up of two corresponding pieces
30 Catkins: a spicate inflorescence (as of the willow, birch, or oak) bearing scaly bracts and unisexual usually apetalous flowers
20 Spadix: a floral spike with a fleshy or succulent axis usually enclosed in a spathe
20 Solitary: occurring singly and not as part of a group or cluster
30 Spikes: an elongated inflorescence similar to a raceme but having the flowers sessile on the main axis
20 Corymbs: a flat-topped inflorescence specifically : one in which the flower stalks arise at different levels on the main axis and reach about the same height and in which the outer flowers open first
10 Thyrses: an inflorescence as in the lilac and horse chestnut in which the main axis is racemose and the secondary and later axes are cymose
30 Capitula: a racemose inflorescence (as of the sunflower) with the axis shortened and dilated to form a rounded or flattened cluster of sessile flowers
20 Cymes: an inflorescence in which each floral axis terminates in a single flower especially : a determinate inflorescence of this type containing several flowers with the first-opening central flower terminating the main axis and subsequent flowers developing from lateral buds
30 Heads : a tight mass of plant parts (as leaves or flowers)
30 Panicle : a compound racemose inflorescence
30 Fascicles: a small or slender bundle (as of pine needles or nerve fibers)
20 Foliose: having a flat, thin, and usually lobed thallus attached to the substratum
30 Brackate: a leaf borne on a floral axis especially : one subtending a flower or flower cluster
Cincinnnae
20 Glomerules: a compacted cyme of almost sessile and usually small flowers
20 Cauliforous: producing flowers from the main stem or older branches
